# ‚úÖ Solution: How to Implement JIRA Automation Rule

## üéØ Goal

Create an automation rule that performs the following:

* **Trigger**: When an issue is created (or transitioned)
* **Action**:

  * Option A: Assign the issue to the **QA Lead**
  * Option B: Send an **email notification** to the QA Lead

You can implement either or both actions depending on your needs.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

* You must have **JIRA Project Administrator** or **JIRA System Admin** permissions.
* A defined **QA Lead** user or email address.

---

### Step 4: Add an Action

#### **Option A: Assign to QA Lead**

3. Click **Save**.

#### **Option B: Send Email Notification**

1. Click **New Action** ‚Üí Select **Send Email**.
2. In the **To** field:

   * Enter QA Lead email (e.g., `qa.lead@example.com`)
     OR use a JIRA group (e.g., `qa-team`)
3. Subject:

   * `New Issue Created: {{issue.key}} - {{issue.summary}}`
4. Body:

   ```text
   A new issue has been created:

   - Key: {{issue.key}}
   - Summary: {{issue.summary}}
   - Reporter: {{issue.reporter.displayName}}
   - Description: {{issue.description}}

   View it here: {{issue.url}}
   ```
5. Click **Save**.

---

### Step 5: Name and Save the Rule

1. Rule Overview
2. Trigger Configuration
3. Action (Assign or Email) Configuration
4. Audit Log / Rule Execution

## üß† Tips

* Use **Smart Values** (`{{issue.fields.summary}}`, `{{issue.url}}`, etc.) for dynamic content.
* Add **Conditions** to apply the rule only for certain issue types, priorities, or labels.
* You can **combine actions** (assign + email) in a single rule.
